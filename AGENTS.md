# Agent Instructions

Purpose: make the testing strategy automatically discoverable for Codex and other agents working in this repository.

Before fixing tests or changing test expectations:

- Read `docs/architecture/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`.
- Classify the failure before editing code.
- Identify the failure category, owner module, and test tier.
- Prefer targeted tests before full `swift test`.
- Do not turn test failures into broad architecture work.
- For Rules-dependent tests, prefer `RulesTestHarness` helpers:
  - `withBundledRules`
  - `withTempRulesBook`
  - `withTempRulesDirectory`
  - `withUnconfiguredRules`
- Treat full `swift test` as closeout, not first diagnostics, unless explicitly requested.
